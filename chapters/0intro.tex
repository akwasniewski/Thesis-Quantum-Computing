\section*{Introduction}
This thesis serves as a brief introduction to quantum computing. We begin with an overview of quantum mechanics, followed by relevant notation and linear algebra concepts. Later, we show the most influential quantum algorithms and the quantum complexity classes they represent. The content is heavily based on chapter 20 of the book "Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach" by S. Arora and B. Barak \cite{thebook}. The aim is to explain the subject in an easy-to-follow way without sacrificing formality.
